[music]

0:00:14.000 --> 0:00:18.000
Someone sank to the bottom

0:00:18.000 --> 0:00:21.000
But nobody cares

0:00:21.000 --> 0:00:26.000
We grieved, but tomorrow we forgot, as if we never were
And we didn't love

0:00:28.000 --> 0:00:31.000
Someone got lost in an endless dream
That is, disappeared

0:00:34.000 --> 0:00:43.000
[music]

0:00:43.000 --> 0:00:49.000
With a cold dawn, a new day rises upon us
Everything will remain in this Universe

0:00:55.000 --> 0:00:59.000
It returns to us, creating circles on the water
Nothing passes without a trace, nothing

0:01:39.000 --> 0:01:46.000
Whose is this? A random move, a fatal turn?
We touched each other on this spiral
We found and lost again

0:01:53.000 --> 0:01:56.000
And we remain
In a cold city, just waiting for it to get warmer, and run, regret nothing

0:02:20.000 --> 0:02:26.000
It returns to us, launching hands
Nothing passes without anything

0:02:50.000 --> 0:02:56.000
[music]

0:02:56.000 --> 0:03:05.000
Moment, moment of revelation, mystery, enigma,
Touch of God, union of delight and
Fear
I tried so many times, but in this very moment, my stone flies into the water

0:03:05.000 --> 0:03:13.000
And yet it always lands at the center of the circle
I tried to throw it to the south, to the west, at sunset, in the morning
With different angles, with stones of different types
With my other hand, in a blind jump
Some trap, but I still end up at the center of the circle

0:03:16.000 --> 0:04:04.000
Year after year
Nothing happens

0:04:11.000 --> 0:04:21.000
[applause]

0:04:21.000 --> 0:04:25.000
Everything revolves
It returns like this, launching

0:04:32.000 --> 0:04:35.000
Nothing passes without a trace

0:04:35.000 --> 0:04:38.000
